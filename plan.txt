So what should the pacecalc do exactly?
- Take in the date
Step 1: take in the unit of distance
Step 2: take in the length of the distance (in either m or km)
Step 3: take in the time it took (first minutes then second
- Convert the minutes and seconds to minutes and a decimal of minutes
- multiply this by the length of distance to calculate the pace
- split the pace which will be in minutes only back into minutes and seconds
- print out the minutes
- ask for a confirmation to save
- if yes, save to a spreadsheet or .txt file or something

What is the general process you do on your own?
You... 
convert the time you ran into minute.decimal
you then divide the distance you ran by 

So you ran a 10K in 55:35
So... that means you ran a time of 55:0.58333

55.

Saving the times to a spreadsheet can be done but idk how to open something that isn't in the same 
folder as the .c file you are reading into.
